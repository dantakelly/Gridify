# Gridify

Gridify is a mini-project featuring two grid layouts - "Grids of Four" and "Grids of Eight". These grids are designed to provide a structured arrangement for content elements within a container. Utilizing cascading style sheets (CSS), Gridify enhances visual coherence and user experience.
